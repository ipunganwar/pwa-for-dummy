### Service Worker FAQ
**Is the Service Worker installed everytime I refresh the page?** <br>
No, whilst the browser does of course (naturally) execute the `register()`  code everytime you refresh the page, it won't install the service worker if the service worker file hasn't changed. If it only changed by 1 byte though, it'll install it as a new service worker (but wait with the activation as explained).

## "Listenable" Events in Service Worker
| Event | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Fetch | Browser or Page-related Javascript initiates a Fetch (HTTP Request) |
| Push Notification | Service Worker receives Web Push Notification (from Server) |
| Notification Interaction | User interacts with displayed notification |
| Background Sync | Service Worker receives background sync event (e.g. Internet Connection was restored) |
| Service Worker Livecycle | Service Worker Phase changes |

## Service Worker Lifecycle
- Install - Trigger by the browser
- Activate - Trigger by the browser
- Fetch - Trigger by your web-app


# Service Worker Strategy in Advanced
## Cache Only
it's similar look like this behaviour, matches with cache in cache-storage:
```
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
   event.respondWith(
     caches.match(event.request)
   );
});
```

## Network Only
it's similar look like this behaviour, only get from fetch request:
```
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
  event.respondWith(
    fetch(event.request)
  );
});
```

## Network With Cache Fallback 
get from network first, if error will get from cache:
```
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
    event.respondWith(
        fetch(event.request)
        .catch(err => {
            return caches.match(event.request)
        })
    )
});
```

## Cache With Offline File Provide
if get from cache has error, we can provide with offline file fallback:
```
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
   event.respondWith(
     caches.match(event.request)
     .catch(err => {
         return caches.open('static-cache-v1')
            .then(cache => {
                return cache.match('/offline.html') ---> this the offline file we had been provide
            })
     })
   );
});
```
